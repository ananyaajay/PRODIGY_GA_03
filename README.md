# Text Generation with Markov Chains 🤖

Implementation of a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains. This task involvescreating a statistical model that predicts the probability of a characteror word based on the previos one(s).

This Python script implements a simple first-order Markov Chain for text generation. It builds a word-based transition dictionary from input text, then generates randomized sentences by probabilistically selecting each next word. Features include modular functions, random selection, and customizable output length, illustrating basic probabilistic modeling and natural language processing concepts.

## ✓ Features:

• Simplicity (accessible for beginners in NLP and Python)

•First-order Markov Chain

• Randomized Text Generation

• Reusable Functions

• Dictionary-based State Storage

•Customizable Output

• Deterministic Training, Random Generation


## ✓ Concepts Used:

• Markov Chain Principle: Utilizes the Markov property, where the next state (word) depends only on the current state, not the sequence of events that preceded it.

• Probabilistic Text Generation: Generates new text sequences by randomly selecting the next word based on learned transition probabilities.

• Dictionary Data Structure: Employs dictionaries to efficiently map each word to its possible following words, allowing fast lookups during generation.

• Randomness and Non-Determinism: Uses random.choice() to introduce variability, ensuring that generated text can differ with each execution.

• Graceful Handling of Edge Cases: Handles scenarios where a given word has no successors, preventing errors and stopping generation as needed.

• Simple Natural Language Processing (NLP): Demonstrates foundational NLP by splitting text and modeling word relationships.

• Customizability: Allows the user to specify starting word and length, offering control over the generated output.


## ✓ Highlights:

• Compact Implementation with Core NLP Principle

• Dynamic Chain Construction and Dictionary-Based Mapping

• Customizable Generation

• Error-Resilient along with Reusable Functions

• Educational Value and Foundation for Extension
