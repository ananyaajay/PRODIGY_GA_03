# Text Generation with Markov Chains ðŸ¤–

Implementation of a simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains. This task involvescreating a statistical model that predicts the probability of a characteror word based on the previos one(s).

This Python script implements a simple first-order Markov Chain for text generation. It builds a word-based transition dictionary from input text, then generates randomized sentences by probabilistically selecting each next word. Features include modular functions, random selection, and customizable output length, illustrating basic probabilistic modeling and natural language processing concepts.

## âœ“ Features:

â€¢ Simplicity (accessible for beginners in NLP and Python)

â€¢First-order Markov Chain

â€¢ Randomized Text Generation

â€¢ Reusable Functions

â€¢ Dictionary-based State Storage

â€¢Customizable Output

â€¢ Deterministic Training, Random Generation


## âœ“ Concepts Used:

â€¢ Markov Chain Principle: Utilizes the Markov property, where the next state (word) depends only on the current state, not the sequence of events that preceded it.

â€¢ Probabilistic Text Generation

â€¢ Dictionary Data Structure

â€¢ Randomness and Non-Determinism

â€¢ Graceful Handling of Edge Cases

â€¢ Simple Natural Language Processing (NLP)

â€¢ Customizability: 


## âœ“ Highlights:

â€¢ Compact Implementation with Core NLP Principle

â€¢ Dynamic Chain Construction and Dictionary-Based Mapping

â€¢ Customizable Generation

â€¢ Error-Resilient along with Reusable Functions

â€¢ Educational Value and Foundation for Extension
